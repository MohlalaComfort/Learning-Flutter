Widgets are components/buikding blocks of interface e.g app bar, text, buttons etc.
- A widget is either stateful or stateless.
- If a widget can change—when a user interacts with it, for example—it's stateful. 
- A stateless widget never changes. Icon , IconButton , and Text are examples of stateless widgets.
